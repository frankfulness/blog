# Introduction

Sketchybar and Aerospace, ever heard of either? Call it an over 30 years old male midlife crisis, but I've finally entered my era of pde (personal development environment) base desires.

What happened to me? I watched Pewdie Pie's Arch Linux YouTube video, fell down the Alice and Wonderland pit of despair, and decided that I refuse to not rice up my machine as if I was on Linux.

Things that annoy me about MacOS out the box:

1. Windows are a pain and the animations when cmd+tab to an app feels like my eyes are getting sucked through a vortex I didn't sign up for, like listening to a friend's uncle rant about something I never agreed to get into.
2. cmd+tab, I feel like I'm in the dark ages, is there no way to get to what I want to faster? Ofc, I've just been living in caveland normie land.
3. Menubar customization is about as customizeable as if you like dark or light, what is this? SMH, facepalm, _deep sigh_, is a little pep in my step too much to ask for, I want some color.
4. I just don't want to see every tray icon of everything and their grandmother at the top of my screen ok?
5. The options to see in an application menu dropdowns is great, but once you learn it, you don't need to see it, it's just clutter. Why isn't this as easy to toggle on/off as it is to hide and show .files I have no idea.

Ok, overall I love MacOS. It's reliable, smooth, a buttery experience, almost everything works on it, and as far as new machines go at any new role I ask for it over a piece of dell potato in slow degrative decline 8/8 times.
But, microanimations aren't for everything and at the end of the day I want my tools to work great and get out of my way when I want them so, enter solution!

### Sketchybar

[Sketchybar for the sick](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)

just look up some of the setups in "Share you setups" and you will instantly realize how little you have been rizzing or ricing up your Mac.

### Aerospace

[Aerospace for Andys'](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)

It's i3 like buttery and smooth, free of massive swooping animations and simple to use with `alt+<number>`, `alt+shift+<number>` to assign, & you don't lose `cmd+tab` if you want to fall back into bad habits.

## Let's dive into setting it up

Nowadays with Warp terminal + Claude 4 sonnet, we can vibe our way through our own configurations without even leaving the terminal (it's weird to call warp a terminal tbh...).

So, it's easy to agent our way through some of the base installation always using **Homebrew** (any surprise there? Nope), and then once we're saradomin brewed up and ready to take some hits, we can see what happens.

in `.config` mkdirnolds your way to a toml config file via `mkdir aerospace && touch aerospace/aerospace.toml`

Here is where we can set things like `start-at-login = true`, 'accordion-padding', 'default-root-container-layout', & more.

Here's my basic one:

```toml:aerospace.toml
# Start AeroSpace at login
start-at-login = true

# Normalizations. See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#normalization
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true

# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#layouts
# The 'accordion-padding' specifies the size of accordion padding
# You can set 0 to disable the padding feature
accordion-padding = 30

# Possible values: tiles|accordion
default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'

# Possible values: horizontal|vertical|auto
# 'auto' means: wide monitor (anything wider than high) gets horizontal orientation,
#               tall monitor (anything higher than wide) gets vertical orientation
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'

# Mouse follows focus when focus changes
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']

# Sketchybar integration - instant updates on workspace changes
exec-on-workspace-change = ['/Users/zion/.local/bin/sketchybar-aerospace-update']

# Gaps between windows (in pixels)
[gaps]
inner.horizontal = 10
inner.vertical =   10
outer.left =       15
outer.bottom =     15
outer.top =        60 # Increased for clean spacing under sketchybar
outer.right =      15

# 'main' binding mode declaration
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#binding-modes

# All possible keys:

# - F-keys.         f1, f2, ..., f20

#                   leftSquareBracket, rightSquareBracket, space, enter, esc, backspace, tab
# - Keypad special. keypadClear, keypadDecimalMark, keypadDivide, keypadEnter, keypadEqual,
#                   keypadMinus, keypadMultiply, keypadPlus
# - Arrows.         left, down, up, right

alt-f = 'fullscreen'

# Alt + s to toggle between horizontal and vertical split
alt-s = 'layout v_accordion' # 'layout h_accordion' | 'layout v_accordion' | 'layout h_tiles' | 'layout v_tiles' | 'layout tiles' | 'layout accordion'

# Alt + r to resize mode (you can also resize by holding Alt + right mouse button)
alt-r = 'mode resize'

[mode.resize.binding]
h = 'resize width -50'

```

Not bad right? Feel free to configure yours however you want.

However, you're going to need Sketchybar to bring this all together...
My sketchybar setup has `colors`, `helpers`, `items`, `plugins`, and scripts like `colors.sh` & `icons.sh`, but most importantly is your `sketchybarrc`.

I attempted to include a color script for warp inspired cololr pallette with proper transparency and this got yoinked.
But the key is you will want to install [sketchybar-app-font](https://github.com/kvndrsslr/sketchybar-app-font) if you want to have a ligature based symbol font inspired by simple bar.
