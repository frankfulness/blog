👋🏻 Hi, thank you for stopping by!
I'm a Full Stack software engineer/DevOps enthusiast based in Northern California proficient in JavaScript (React, TypeScript), Python, & currently learning Go.

Over the past decade, I’ve built a dynamic career blending client-side expertise with server-side development. Currently I'm deeply focused on DevOps, in my current role.

I value adaptability, efficiency, and collaboration. Whether it’s writing scalable code, setting up CI/CD pipelines, or tinkering under the hood of new technologies, I bring a holistic approach to add value to every project.
