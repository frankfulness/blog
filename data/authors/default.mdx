👋🏻 Hi, thank you for stopping by.
I'm a Full Stack software engineer/DevOps enthusiast recently moved from Northern California to Phoenix Arizona that's proficient in JavaScript (React/Vue, TypeScript), Python, & currently learning Go.

Over the past decade, I’ve built a dynamic career blending client-side expertise with server-side development. Currently I'm deeply focused on building SPA's, aws event driven architecture, infrastructure, & scaling up in my current role.

I value adaptability, efficiency, and collaboration. Whether it’s writing scalable code, setting up CI/CD pipelines, or tinkering under the hood of new technologies, I bring a holistic approach to add value to every project.
